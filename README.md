# LangChain LLM Playground

## 🚀 About This Project

This repository contains code and examples from the LangChain course by [CampusX](https://www.youtube.com/@campusx-official). It demonstrates how to implement and utilize various Large Language Models (LLMs) through the LangChain framework.

## 📚 What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:
- Are context-aware
- Can reason with their own knowledge base
- Connect to other sources of data and computation

## 🛠 Project Structure

- `chatmodel/`: Implementation of chat-based language models
- `LLM/`: Basic LLM integration demos
- `embedded/`: For vector embeddings and retrieval
- `browser-tools-mcp/`: Browser tools integrations

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- LangChain & LangChain Core
- OpenAI models (GPT-4, etc.)
- Anthropic models (Claude)
- Google Gemini (formerly PaLM)
- Hugging Face models
- Streamlit for UI
- Python environment management

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Create a `.env` file with your API keys (see `.env.example`)

## 🔑 API Keys

You'll need to obtain API keys for the LLM providers you want to use:
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/
- Google AI: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
